# CodeBaseUnified

## Why this exists?:

This exists for the sole purpose of code reuse. There are things that I write frequently in code like the image class that I need not redefine everytime, so what I do is define them here and include in projects.

This repository also holds some information for quick reference as and when I need it, snippets to remind myself of some concepts, frequently encountered errors and ways to solve them etc.

## Want to add something?:
Go for it; create a pull request, I'll try my best to review and pull into the repo, otherwise, use it as you please!
